The greatest expandable gallery for your wordpress website, seamless visualization, totally responsive... A unique way to show your images!

== Description ==

**Looking for the greatest gallery for wordpress?**

Inspired by Google´s image gallery we have created a gallery for Wordpress that replaces the standard with one that gives you the ability to open images inside the content without the need to load a new page or use a modal box. This improves user experience and brings dynamism, speed and usability to your site.

* You can see it working in our [live DEMO](http://dev.hey.uy/xpand-gallery-lite-demo/ "Xpand Gallery Lite Demo")

**Features:**

* Seamless visualization: You can enlarge you images on the same page the user is navigating.
* Responsive design: Mobile devices and desktop devices are fully supported!
* Customize it to suit your needs: options panel in the WordPress backend makes it easy to fit and integrate with your design!
* Navigation with keyboard arrows
* Images preload using Ajax
* Set visualization height
* Set animation speed

**Want the Xpand Gallery Pro?**

Aside from the lite version options you can have advanced features such as:

* Widget ready: The plugin adds a useful widget area, where you can place any content you want.
* Support for multiple galleries on the same page. 
* Many styling and functionality options to customize the plugin to your needs.
* You can see it in action [here](http://dev.hey.uy/xpand-gallery-for-wordpress/ "Xpand Gallery Pro")
